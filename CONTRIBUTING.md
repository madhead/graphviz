# Contributing

I love pull requests from everyone.
Contributing is easy:

 - You can report bugs and request features using the [issues page](https://github.com/madhead/graphviz/issues).
 - You can easily work on the code if you have a GitHub account ([get one](https://github.com/join)).

Fork the project, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:<your-github-account>/graphviz.git

Make your changes.
Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/madhead/graphviz/compare).

At this point you're waiting on me.
I'll try to check the PR as soon as possible, but it may take weeks.

And, please, use descriptive commit messages, so that the intention of the PR is clear.
Or at least make them funny.

Happy hacking!
